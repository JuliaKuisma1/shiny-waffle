Portfolio of my school assignments.

1. ChatApp:

The main idea was to create a chat application where everything is managed with ajax calls. The main functions are login (only with username) and sending messages.

2. MVC assignment:

The main idea was to create an application with MVC and php. The main functions are login, list users, add users and delete them.

3. MemoryGame:

The main idea was to create a memory game using javascript (no added libraries). The app tracks the amount of time and moves taken.
